# Gold-Price-Prediciton
Gold Price Prediction 🏆

Here we are going to predict the price of gold using several available data 📊
The model we are going to use here is RandomForestRegressor 🌳

Here we are predicting the price of gold with other currency pair or commodities. 💹
The instruments we have here are Silver, Spx, United States Oil price and EURUSD 📈

A note 📝: Here we are not forecasting, forecasting is a separate problem.
We will look at forecasting later. For forecasting we will use LSTM long-short-term memory 🕰️.
